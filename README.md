# PROGRAMMING AND SCRIPTING PROJECT - IRIS DATASET
by Hugo van Zyl

## Project Overview
This repository contains python data analysis code for the famous Iris dataset. The project demonstrates various data analysis and visualization techniques using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## Iris Dataset Overview 
The Iris flower dataset is a classic dataset was made famous by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher. The original data was collected by Edgar Anderson. 

It contains:
- 150 samples (50 from each of the three Iris flower species)
- 4 features / variables: sepal length (cm), sepal width (cm), petal length (cm) and petal width (cm)
- 3 classes / species: Setosa, Versicolor and Virginica

## Project Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

- .gitignore - This is the git ignore file
- Iris_summary_stats.txt - This file contains the output from Task 3.1 code in the analysis.ipynb file
- README.md - This is the readme file containing the project overview
- analysis.ipynb - This is the main code file containing all tasks for this project and associated explanations with references
- iris.data - This is the original Iris data file downloaded from the UC Irvine website
- petal length (cm)-histogram.png - This is a image file of the petal lenght histogram plot (output from analysis.ipynb file)
- petal width (cm)-histogram.png - This is a image file of the petal width histogram plot (output from analysis.ipynb file)
- sepal length (cm)-histogram.png - This is a image file of the sepal length histogram plot (output from analysis.ipynb file)
- sepal width (cm)-histogram.png - This is a image file of the sepal width histogram plot (output from analysis.ipynb file)

## Installation & Code Excecution
To run this project, open the analysis.ipynb file. You will need Python installed along with the following libraries: pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn

For best results, run the analysis.ipynb file in VS Code or Jupyter Notebooks. You can also download the Anaconda IDE suite to access these compilers. To run the code, simply click on the run (play button) starting from the top of the notebook. No user data input is required.

## Task Overview
The project is divided into distinct tasks, each focusing on different aspects of data analysis:

- Task 1: Research the data set online and write a summary about it in your README.
- Task 2: Download the data set and add it to your repository.
- Task 3.1: Output a summary of each variable to a single text file
- Task 3.2: Saves a histogram of each variable to png files
- Task 3.3: Outputs a scatter plot of each pair of variables
- Task 3.4.1: Creates a correlation matrix and heatmap of the data
- Task 3.4.2: Creates a boxplot of all variables
- Findings: Discussion of observations from the data analysis results
